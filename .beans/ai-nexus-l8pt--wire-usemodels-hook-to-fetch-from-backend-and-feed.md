## Goal

Uncomment and implement `use-models.ts` to fetch the real model list from `GET /api/v1/models`, then feed it into the new model selector popover.

## Tasks

- [ ] Implement `useModels()` hook in `frontend/features/chat/hooks/use-models.ts` (currently fully commented out)
- [ ] Define a `Model` type (id, display_name, provider) and a `GroupedModels` type (provider -> Model[])
- [ ] Transform the flat API response into grouped-by-provider structure for the selector
- [ ] Replace the hardcoded model list in `ChatView.tsx` with data from `useModels()`
- [ ] Wire the new model selector popover component into `ChatView.tsx` in place of the current ai-elements one

## Blocked by

- `ai-nexus-x22k` (backend models endpoint must return real data first)

## Key Files

- `frontend/features/chat/hooks/use-models.ts` (commented stub)
- `frontend/features/chat/ChatView.tsx` (hardcoded model list + selector)
- `frontend/lib/api.ts` (endpoint already defined: `/api/v1/models`)
