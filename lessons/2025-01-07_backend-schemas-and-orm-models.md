* An ORM Model is a Table Class.
* Schema != ORM Model -- Schema is for request/response validation, and the ORM Model is for database creation/updating.

* In SQLAlchemy `mapped_column()` is used when you need to specify additional information. You can add attributes without necessarily using `mapped_column()`.
