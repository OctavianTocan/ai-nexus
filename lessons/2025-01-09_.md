- I'm going to set up a relationship between the messages table, and the conversations table in such a way where Conversation.messages will lead to the correct entry in the messages table?
- Using `back_populates` in a `relationship()` in SQLAlchemy is a way to let Python know that we're connecting fields between two different models. However, this does not tell the actual database what model or field it has to point to. For that, we use `ForeignKey`.
